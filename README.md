# PhoneController

WIP
Basic Controller working with livelink. Once given the IP address on the controller you will be connected to the live link and use ur device as controller.
Right now working on phone application for the controller and finishing to set up the plugin.

Right now to be able to use that you'll need to give the LiveLink controller to your character and set up the blueprint to get all the input.
In the future won't be necessary.
